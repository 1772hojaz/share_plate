SHAREPLATE RWANDA

Overview

The mobile app SharePlate Rwanda aims to tackle food insecurity and food waste in Rwanda. This app brings people together who have surplus food, restaurants and grocery stores with those who need food. SharePlate Rwanda is built using Flutter and aims to focus on a smooth, exciting and inclusive user experience with features that help users easily share and request, and in turn manage food resources; all safely.


Project Goals


Our project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient platform that:

-- Connects food donors with recipients in need, to promote Food Security.

-- Redistribution of surplus food within a community, to reduce Food Waste.

-- Accessible design and community based approach encourages sustainability.


Front-End Design Principles


-- Responsive Design: It’s optimized for portrait and landscape orientations, so your experience is going to be the same no matter what device you use.

-- Material Design Standards: This gives us a nice and intuitive UI, which is aligned with Material Design principles, by having a layout, colors, typography and animation that sticks to Google’s Material Design.


Key Features


-- User Authentication: Tailored secure sign-up and login processes for individuals, restaurants and grocery stores.

-- Food Sharing Platform: Donating and requesting food is simple.

-- Location-Based Matching: It simplifies the food distribution logistics and connects users based on proximity.

-- Real-Time Notifications: Alerts on food availability as well as pick update.

-- Impact Tracking: Users can know how they can contribute and how they are helping to reduce the amount of food waste.


Widget and state management use


-- To get a responsive and dynamic front end experience, we’ve used a number of Flutter widgets and state management techniques.


Widget Usage


-- Extensive and Creative Use of Widgets: It uses a nice mix of widgets when it comes to layouts, inputs and interactions, and I really like their reference to the Flutter’s widget library.

-- Stateful Widgets and setState: SETSTATE is used for the management of dynamic changes of Interactive elements such as forms, buttons & toggle switches.

-- Animations and Transitions: Visual appeal is augmented via subtle animations which improve user flow and add feedback, without undermining functionality.


State Management


-- Efficient State Management: As we wanted to keep responsiveness and scalability, we’ve integrated state management solutions that works well for each feature. For instance:

-- Provider or BLoC Pattern (future implementations): They will be employed to accelerate the bandwidth of state and streamline the data flow specifically for user sessions, notifications, and food sharing activities.


Code Quality


Our code follows clean, organized, and readable standards, reflecting best practices and ensuring maintainability:

-- Meaningful Naming Conventions: Variables, functions, and classes names are all descriptive and allows codebse to be easily navigated.

-- Consistent Formatting: Code has consistent indentation, line breaks, spacing, etc.

-- Modular Structure: It is divided into reusable functions and widgets, as such, in a modular design approach.

-- Comprehensive Comments: Comments around each function and core component explain its usage, design choices, logic etc.

-- Error Handling and Edge Cases: Potential errors and edge cases (blank forms, incorrect data entry) are handled with care, resulting in a pleasant user experience.

Future Enhancements


We aim to continue developing and optimizing SharePlate Rwanda to meet evolving user needs:

-- Backend Integration: Building a robust backend to store and retrieve real time data.

-- Enhanced State Management: Better state management integration with advanced state management (Provider/BLoC) for better scalability.

-- User Metrics Dashboard: To allow users to see detailed insights on food sharing and personal impact.

-- Advanced Security Features: It further builds data privacy and user authentication.
